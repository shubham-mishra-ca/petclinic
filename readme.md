# React Frontend for Spring Boot PetClinic demo


This project is a Spring Boot application with a frontend built using [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). 




## Install and run

Note: Spring Boot Server App must be running before starting the client!

To start the server, launch a Terminal and run from the project's root folder (`spring-petclinic`):
```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

When the server is running you can try to access the API for example to query all known pet types:
```
curl http://localhost:8080/api/pettypes
```

After starting the server you can install and run the client from the `client` folder:

1. `npm install` (installs the node modules and the TypeScript definition files)
2. `PORT=4444 npm start` 
3. Open `http://localhost:4444`

(Why not use the same server for backend and frontend? Because Webpack does a great job for serving JavaScript-based SPAs and I think it's not too uncommon to run this kind of apps using two dedicated server, one for backend, one for frontend)


------

## Running petclinic locally
```
	git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
	cd spring-petclinic
	git checkout springboot
	./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

You can then access petclinic here: http://localhost:8080/


## Database configuration

In its default configuration, Petclinic uses an in-memory database (HSQLDB) which
gets populated at startup with data. A similar setup is provided for MySql in case a persistent database configuration is needed.
Note that whenever the database type is changed, the data-access.properties file needs to be updated and the mysql-connector-java artifact from the pom.xml needs to be uncommented.

You may start a MySql database with docker:

```
docker run -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=petclinic -e MYSQL_DATABASE=petclinic -p 3306:3306 mysql:5.7.8
```

## Working with Petclinic in Eclipse/STS

### prerequisites
The following items should be installed in your system:
* Maven 3 (http://www.sonatype.com/books/mvnref-book/reference/installation.html)
* git command line tool (https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)
* Eclipse with the m2e plugin (m2e is installed by default when using the STS (http://www.springsource.org/sts) distribution of Eclipse)

Note: when m2e is available, there is an m2 icon in Help -> About dialog.
If m2e is not there, just follow the install process here: http://eclipse.org/m2e/download/


### Steps:

1) In the command line
```
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
```
2) Inside Eclipse
```
